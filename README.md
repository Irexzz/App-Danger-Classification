# Dangerous Driving Prediction System App
A Tkinter-based GUI application to predict driver behavior and trip safety using machine learning models.
# Description
This project implements a user-friendly GUI application developed with Tkinter to predict:
  1. Dangerous Driver: Identifies whether a driver is likely to be dangerous based on personal and historical driving behavior.
  2. Dangerous Trip: Assesses if a specific trip is risky based on input factors like speed, acceleration and car.
     
The application uses trained classification models to provide real-time predictions for both use cases, aiming to enhance road safety and reduce accidents.
# Key Features
Dual Predictions: Separate models for driver safety and trip risk prediction.

Tkinter GUI: Simple and interactive interface for users to input data and view results.

Machine Learning Models: Classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

Visualization: Graphical insights into feature importance and model performance.

Customizable Input: The application accepts input for key parameters like age, experience, speed.
